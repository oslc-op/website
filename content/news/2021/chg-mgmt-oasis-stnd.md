OASIS is pleased to announce that the [Call for Consent](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ballot.php?id=3619) has closed and, effective 26 May 2021, **OSLC Change Management Version 3.0** is an OASIS Standard according to the [Call for Consent procedure](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#OScallForConsent). Project Administration will now undertake the final tasks of preparing and loading the standard. 

Change Management Version 3.0 was one of the first approved Project Specifications to come out of the new OASIS Open Project Program and its first OASIS Standard. The Project Governing Board will be acting on additional deliverables over the next few months.

The ballot was held under the OASIS call for consent procedure. In the ballot, the Candidate OASIS Standard received 7 affirmative votes and no objections. 

OASIS congratulations the members of the OSLC Open Project and to the community of implementers, developers and users who have brought the work successfully to this milestone.
