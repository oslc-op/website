The PROSTEP OpenPDM OSLC Adapter makes your PLM system(s) available to the OSLC world. It offers OSLC standard services, especially for those PLM systems which donâ€™t  offer native ones. The adapter is an add-on for the OpenPDM integration framework which provides connectors to a wide range of systems. The OpenPDM OSLC services can be integrated in any OSLC consuming applications. The gap between ALM and PLM can be closed.

This presentation provides details on the OpenPDM OSLC Adapter including overview, reference project and technical information. For more details  contact infocenter@prostep.com.
