The table below provides a convenient place to see the currently available OSLC specifications, their status, and links to the documents.  Many of these specifications are still under development so you should consult the actual documents for the most up to date information.

> **The vocabularies for use in applications can be found on the [Vocabularies](vocabularies) page.**

The titles below are abbreviated for convenience. The full titles a available from the linked documents. For multi-part specifications, typically only the main specification is listed. The other parts are available from that specification.

Status refers to the OASIS Standards Track Work Products in the [OASIS Naming Directives](http://docs.oasis-open.org/specGuidelines/ndr/namingDirectives.html#stage)

* Working Draft (WD) \[not approved, no official status\]
* Project Specification Draft (PSD)
<!-- * Committee Specification Public Review Draft (CSPRD) -->
* Project Specification (PS)
* Candidate for OASIS Standard (COS)
* OASIS Standard (OS)
* *Final* Indicates an open-services.net OSLC specification that has not yet been migrated to OASIS.

Note: The open-services.net specifications that are being migrated to OASIS by the OSLC Domains TC are strictly a document maintenance exercise. That is, a *Final* open-service.net specification may appear as an OASIS CSD with different formatting, but will have the same specification normative content. Migration of these documents to OASIS will therefore have no impact on implementations. open-services.net specifications that do not yet have at least OASIS CSD status will reference the existing (PDF) open-services.net specification, and the status will be shown in *italics*.

* [Estimation and Measurement](https://archive.open-services.net/wiki/estimation-and-measurement/Estimation-and-Measurement-Service-Version-1.0_-REST-API/index.html)
* [Actions 2.0](https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/trunk/specs/actions.html)

Obsolete or abandoned specifications:

* [Reporting](https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/ReportingSpecifications.html)
* [Product Definition](https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/PlmSpecExtensions.html)


Anyone interested in contributing to these specifications should join the applicable TC and propose additional work to add to the TC charter.
