We went through a release review process even though it is not strictly needed for the service releases just in order to get acquainted with the process.\n\nThis release has mainly addressed issues in the client (28 issues) and core (9 issues). I would like to thank all contributors who submitted the patches!\n\nAs of now, artefacts under groupId=org.eclipse.lyo.clients and groupId=org.eclipse.lyo.oslc4j.core are available under artifactId=2.1.2. Please make sure your POM file specifies the correct repositories.\n\nThe Javadoc sites are also published:\n\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/lyo/docs/core/2.1.2/overview-summary.html\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/lyo/docs/client/2.1.2/overview-summary.html\n\nWe will be starting to work on [2.2.0 roadmap](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510999\n) soon. We are looking forward to your feedback on Lyo 2.1.2 and bug reports as well patches for 2.2.0!\n",

              "content": "\nWe are delighted to announce today the Lyo 2.2.0 release! The artefacts are available immediately from the Eclipse maven repository, the Lyo Toolchain Designer is available for download from the Lyo P2 update site.\n\nMain features of the 2.2.0 release are:\n\n‚ú® Lyo Toolchain Designer plugin\n\nThe Lyo Toolchain Designer plugin is now officially released as part of the Lyo project. Toolchain Designer allows you to graphically model a complete OSLC toolchain (including interactions between OSLC servers and clients), as well as a single server and/or client. From such models, the Lyo Code Generator can then automatically generate an almost complete OSLC4J-compliant Java web project. To model and generate your first toolchain, follow the Lyo Designer tutorial.\n\n‚ú® Lyo Store\n\nLyo Store allows you to persist OSLC resources into SPARQL triplestore of your choice, through ORM-like operations. Lyo Store can be used to provide capabilities such as caching, SPARQL queries, etc. Start by going through an introductory Lyo Store tutorial.\n\nüî• Maven only\n\nOSLC4J projects rely now only on Maven for configuration. If you work from source code using Eclipse, please follow the instructions for working from source.\n\nüîß Fixes\n\nLogging has been fixed (Bug 513477): the logging library implementation (eg slf4j-log4j12) is not included in the JARs now (also all direct uses of Log4j have been rewritten to use SLF4J API). We also work around old Jena versions that bundle logging library implementations. In order to make sure that no logging messages disappear from your applications, make sure to include at least one SLF4J logging backend in your application (and configure it if needed). If you have a Log4j configuration file in your application, you can add the drop-in dependency towards slf4j-log4j12 to have logging work as before. If you are just starting with a new application, we recommend you to try slf4j-simple, which requires zero configuration.\n\nThe following bugs were fixed:\n\nBug 517298 - Generated createResourceShape method on a Resource class produces wrong URIs\nBug 494933 - Architecture resource and link type resources not possible to unmarshall\nBug 517338 - GET requests to obtain RDF/XML representations of resourceShapes are no longer available\nBug 518269 - Add a system property to always use RDF/XML-ABBREV for ServiceProvider resources\nBug 518805 - Generated service class needs to set OSLC-Core-Version header\nBug 430390 - Missing call to resolve path parameters in method-path annotation for CreationFactory annotation\nBug 519818 - Update jena-core version to 2.13 in all projects\n\nBest regards,\nAndrew, Jad, and Jim\n\n[1]: https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/lyo-releases/org/eclipse/lyo/\n[2]: http://download.eclipse.org/lyo/p2/releases/2.2.0\n[3]: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/ContributorsGettingStarted\n[4]: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/modellingandgeneration/workingfromsource_code\n",

              "content": "\nShort summary\n\nMigration to Github is complete; Lyo now supports JSON-LD and Turtle; Lyo Designer generates OpenAPI/Swagger docs and adds modelling support for SHACL shapes. Lyo 2.4 is expected to be the last 2.x release. We also make a switch to a better changelog convention.\n\n ‚ú® Added\n\nJSON-LD support has been added to Lyo Core. Thanks to Ricardo Javier Herrera Ledesma from Koneksys for his effort!\nLyo Designer now allows modelling SHACL shapes. Code generation of SHACL shapes has not been implemented yet. If this is something you need, get in touch! Thanks to Yash Khatri from SCANIA for this contribution.\nLyo Designer now allows to generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for your OSLC Server; see the details below. Thanks to Jad El-khoury and SCANIA for this contribution.\nTurtle support is now turned on by default in Lyo Designer for the generated code.\nSupport for OSLC Query has been added to Lyo Store. Thanks to Jad El-khoury and SCANIA for this contribution.\nOpenJDK 11 has been added to the test matrix for most repos. JDK 11 is not yet supported officially, however.\nA lyo repository has been added to manage all cross-cutting issues that span multiple repos.\nKotlin is now used for unit tests in Lyo Core.\n\nSwagger Docs\n\nTo begin generating docs yourself, head over to the page on Lyo wiki.\n\nüî• Changed\n\nLyo Core now depends on Jena 3.6 (Lyo 2.3 depends on Jena 3.0.1 and that was a breaking change). This was needed to add support for JSON-LD.\nLyo Designer no longer alters your identifiers. Shapes using spaces in their titles are affected.\nLyo Designer now relies on Sirius 5. No breaking changes to the functionality of Lyo Designer have been introduced as a result of this change.\nLyo Validation is not a part of this release in order to preserve the Type B (full IP check). Its dependencies have only passed Type A (license checks only) from the Eclipse IP team. Version 0.2.0.RC is published along this release but is not part of it. Validation has also changed its group ID as part of the process.\nAll repos have been migrated over to Github. You can get an overview of all projects here.\nAs part of the migration, the folder layout has been updated to use the same directory names as the artefact IDs.\nThe following artefacts have been moved across repositories:\n    oslc4j-registry (from Core to to Server)\n    oslc4j-wink (from Core to to Server)\n    oslc4j-stockquote-sample (from Core to to OSLC/lyo-samples)\n    oslc4j-test-sample (from Core to to OSLC/lyo-samples)\n    oslc-java-samples (from Client to OSLC/lyo-samples)\n    oauth-test (from Client to OSLC/lyo-samples)\n    OSLCSharepoint (from Server to to OSLC/lyo-samples)\n    hudson-oslc-auto (from Server to to OSLC/lyo-samples)\n    org.eclipse.lyo.samples.excel (from Server to to OSLC/lyo-samples)\n    oslc4j-bugzilla-sample (from Docs to to OSLC/lyo-samples)\n    trs4j-bugzilla-sample (from Docs to to OSLC/lyo-samples)\n\nOther changes\n\nAccept any kind of Sets, return HashSets ¬∑ Issue 15 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.designer\n\nüëã Deprecated\n\nHTML-related methods in the resource classes. Generator will not produce them in the next major version of Lyo.\nWink support is deprecated and will be replaced with Jersey in the next major release\nPerl client is no longer maintained and will be removed in the next major release\n\n üóëÔ∏è Removed\n\nNo removals were done that materially affect the artefacts that are part of the release. Lyo 2.4.0 versioning adheres to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (but earlier 2.x releases of Lyo have introduced certain braking changes, such as the upgrade to Jena 3 in Lyo 2.3).\n\nBug 532688 removes support for Window Name protocol for Delegated UI communication. The feature has been broken at least since 2.1.0 and contained potential security vulnerability as reported by Rahul Singh (IBM). IE11+ and all modern browsers support the Post Message protocol. NB! If you are still using Window Name protocol, get in touch (details are at the bottom).\n\nLyo Designer 2.4 no longer supports Eclipse Neon (released on June 22, 2016) and older releases.\n\nMost of the sample code have been moved to the OSLC/lyo-samples repository. Note that the sample code has not been part of the released artefacts previously.\n\nüêú Fixed\n\nCore\n\nBug 533213 - rdf:Seq deserialization in JMH contains no elements by neormx ¬∑ Pull Request 14 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.core\n\nClient\n\n529618 ‚Äì Override all OslcClient#getResource(...) in OslcOAuthClient\n\nDesigner\n\nWhen classes & property names use reserve names, RDF names get messed up too ¬∑ Issue #18 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.designer\nAdaptorInterface palette labels should lose the prefix ¬∑ Issue #19 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.designer\nAmbiguous methods created for the Creation Factory in the Mgr class ¬∑ Issue #24 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.designer\nExtra semicolon inserted in the SP Info class if the instance id was customised ¬∑ Issue #36 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.designer\n\nStore\n\nasking for a resource/subject with a URI that does not exist in teh store causes an exception ¬∑ Issue #31 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.store\nGet 1st level blank nodes along with referencing resource. ¬∑ Issue #24 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.store\n\nValidation\n\nException caused when creating an oslc-shape out of the shacl-shape class annotations - using JMH ¬∑ Issue #16 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.validation\nFix datatype of ShaclIn ¬∑ Issue #17 ¬∑ eclipse/lyo.validation\n\nüîê Security\n\nA potential XSS vulnerability in the OSLC Creation and Selection dialogs have been fixed in Bug 532687. Thanks to Rahul Singh from IBM for disclosure. Also, there was a potential XSS vulnerability in the broken Window Name protocol implementation; the support for it has been removed as described above.\n\n üôã Get in touch\n\nWe value you feedback! The best place to share it is the Lyo forum on the open-services.net but a few other places work as well (though we are in process of winding most of them down)! You are also welcome to comment on Lyo 4.0 roadmap draft!\n\nLyo no longer uses Eclipse Bugzilla for issue management. Please file any issues directly on the Github repositories.\n\nOther information\n\nRelease date: 2018-11-25 (release review approved on 2018-11-21).\n\nLyo 2.4 official release page on Eclipse\nLyo 2.4 release issue on Github\nLyo 2.4 roadmap",

              "content": "\nWe are pleased to announce a big step forward for OSLC!\n\nThe most exciting thing that we heard throughout the OSLCfest 2018 conference was that people were\neager to contribute and were asking for a simpler, more streamlined way to provide contributions and\n make their voices heard. After exploring several alternatives, the OSLC Steering Committee decided\n to shift ongoing work from the OASIS Technical Committees to a new OSLC Open Project under the\n recently-announced OASIS Open Project program.\n\nThe OSLC Open Project provides an avenue for anyone to get involved in the ongoing development of OSLC\n standards. And it expands the types of work that can be contributed. Within the OP, you can help\n build reference implementations, test suites, samples and other content to help guide the development,\n  verification and use of these specifications by grounding them in the reality of real implementations.\n\nAs an open source Open Project, people will be able to participate without having to join OASIS\n(though you will need to agree to the OASIS CLA when you make your first contribution). You will be\nable to fork the repositories, propose edits via pull requests, open or comment on issues, and\nsubscribe to the project email list.\n\nIf you are interested in going further and taking a more active role, you can request a seat on the\n Technical Steering Committee. If you want to take a leadership position, your company can join as a\n sponsor and you can join the Project Governing Board.\n\nThe project is up and running now. See open-services.net, the project's website, for general\ninformation and the project's GitHub organization page for a look at the\nwork underway.\n\nWe hope that you are excited about this step as we are. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to\nreach out to us or, for general information on the Open Projects program, to the OP-Administrator\nChet Ensign.",

The OSLC\nOP Project Governing Board has approved\nthe publication of the Change Management 2.1 PSD (Project Specification Draft) 03.\n\nThis specification defines the OSLC Change Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for\nthe management of product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships between those and\nrelated resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources. To support these\nscenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP\nmethods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.\nThe table of all specs has been updated to point to the\nnewly published draft, which is available in the OASIS repository for OSLC specs: [OSLC CM 2.1\nPSD 03](https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/cm/v3.0/psd03/change-mgt-spec.html).\n\nThe project contributors have already submitted the next draft (for the Requirements Management 2.1 spec) for the PGB vote and PSDs for the Core and Quality management are on the way!

              "title": "OLSC Survey Provides Insights into Needs for Software Integration Standards",
              "content": "\nThe Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) steering committee is gathering feedback from the community to help shape the future vision and mission for OSLC. As part of that effort a survey of the community members was conducted and it highlights some interesting results about the needs of this group. You can find the full results of the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-2XVJT6CR/.\n\nOSLC is an open community that builds standards to solve a vexing problem: How to integrate the specialized software used by different types of software and systems development practitioners so teams and their tools can work together.\n\nFor example, it‚Äôs wildly inefficient for a software tester to file defect reports in her specialized QA software and then send an email to the development team to tell them about the defect so they can manually enter it into their Agile development management tools. There is no place for this type of carrier pigeon communication in today‚Äôs world of short development cycles and continuous delivery.\n\nA note about methodology: The survey was advertised via several OSLC-related communication channels and participants self-selected the survey rather than being a random sample. This means the results represent the opinions of that group and may not necessarily be representative of the opinions of the wider community.\n\nIntegration is desired for both Systems and Software\n\nThe first category in the chart above is ‚ÄúSoftware Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Tools/DevOps (e.g. Agile, Testing, Requirements, Continuous Integration, etc.) with over 70% of respondents indicating that this is of interest. Systems Engineering and Product Lifecycle Management were also identified as key areas of integration for the OSLC community. While not specifically asked in this survey, supporting the collaboration between SDLC and the world of Systems and Product Lifecycle Management is a key area where OSLC can be applied.\n\nTraceability is key\n\nNearly 80% of the participants identified ‚ÄúTraceability across tools‚Äù as a desired benefit of integrating tools. The second and third most common responses were ‚ÄúRequirements coordination with test planning‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeveloper collaboration with QA.‚Äù All three of these top responses require an element of traceability between the artifacts managed by each discipline. This is a need that OSLC‚Äôs linked data architecture is particularly well suited to address.\n\nHigher OSLC adoption is needed\n\nLike any standard, the benefits of adopting OSLC increase as more organizations adopt the standard. Before a standard is widely used, early adopters need to invest in supporting it to create the necessary critical mass. There are more than 50 known tools that can support OSLC either natively or through a third-party adapter. However, there is still a need for higher adoption and more native support for OSLC among non-IBM tools. The survey reflects this and highlights the ‚Äúchicken and egg‚Äù dilemma, where higher industry adoption would be the primary motivator for the respondents‚Äô organizations to adopt OSLC. With more than 50 tools already capable of supporting OSLC and more than 10 third-party adapter technologies, there is clearly a strong level of industry momentum. See below for more information on how to participate in the discussion on driving OSLC to the next level of adoption where ‚Äúadoption‚Äù itself is no longer an impediment.\n\nIntegration is needed across a broad range of tools\n\nThe survey identified 55 different tools that respondents might have a need to integrate. Some 41 out of these 55 were selected by multiple people. It‚Äôs also interesting to note not only the diversity in products/vendors but also in the types of tools involved. The list includes tools for requirements, Agile development, QA/Testing, source code management, PLM, and Service Desk. Together this indicates a long tail of integration needs across a large set of tools. Again this highlights both the need and the potential benefits of a standardized integration approach.\n\nThe OSLC steering committee is always looking for more feedback to help improve integration through open technology. We welcome your comments at open-services.net forums and the OSLC LinkedIn Group.  Together, we can stop the insanity of carrier pigeon communication across teams and tools.\n",
