<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p><em>(this section is informative)</em></p>
<p>The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) initiative is
creating a family of web services specifications for products, services
and other tools that support all phases of the software and product
lifecycle. The purpose of these specifications is to enable integration
between products that support Application Life-cycle Management (ALM)
and Product Life-cycle Management (PLM). Each part of the lifecycle or
domain has its own group and specification, for example there are Change
Management, Quality Management, Estimation &amp; Measurement and more. Each
of the domain specifications are built upon this core specification.</p>
<p>This OSLC Core Specification sets out the common features that every
OSLC Service can be expected to support using terminology from the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C). New terminology that we introduce can be
found in the glossary section below. This specification is mostly about
OSLC Services, it specifies what OSLC Services MUST, SHOULD and MAY do.
It also contains some required behaviors for OSLC clients and rules for
OSLC domain specifications that extend this specification.</p>
<p>OSLC Services are accessible via a Service Provider Resource that
describes the Services offered. Each Service can provide Creation
Factories for resource creation, Query Capabilities for resource query
and Delegated UI Dialogs to enable clients to create and select
resources via a web UI. Query Capabilities and Creation Factories may
offer Resource Shapes that describe the properties of resources managed
by the service. This is illustrated in the diagram below. See the
section below on Service Provider Resources for further discussion of
these concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Figure #1: OSLC Core Specification concepts and relationships</strong></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This specification establishes terminology and rules for defining
resources in terms of the property names and value-types that are
allowed and required. OSLC domain specifications are expected to use
these rules and terminologies to describe their resources. See the OSLC
Defined Resources section for more on this topic.</p>
<p>This specification also sets out rules for creating resource
representations in RDF/XML, JSON, Atom and Turtle formats. OSLC domain
specifications are expected to refer to these rules when specifying how
their resources are to be represented. See the OSLC Defined Resource
Representations section for the representation rules and examples of
each format.</p>
<p>#AboutTheVersionNumber <strong>About the version number.</strong> We use the version
number &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; even though there has never been an OSLC Core Version 1.0
specification. We do this because this OSLC Core specification was
written after a series of version 1.0 domain specifications were
finalized by OSLC workgroups. The version 2.0 domain specifications will
all be based on this Core specification and <em>to avoid confusion</em> this
specification will also be known as Version 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>About RDF</strong>. The resource and property-based data model used in OSLC
resources is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and OSLC
requires RDF representations, but OSLC uses a small number of RDF
concepts and does not require implementers to provide an RDF
triple-store or a SPARQL query-engine.</p>
<h2 id="design-considerations">Design considerations</h2>
<p>The core philosophies of OSLC are to build on the powerful and scalable
architecture of the World Wide Web and to do the simplest possible
things that will work.</p>
<p><strong>Build on the WWW</strong>. OSLC builds on the architecture of the WWW and
follows the REST architectural pattern. This means that OSLC Services
provide a uniform HTTP interface, OSLC URIs are stable and opaque and,
in simple terms, OSLC works like the web.</p>
<p><strong>Keep things simple</strong>. Doing the simplest things that will possibly
work means a couple of different things in regard to OSLC. It means
starting with simple and existing concepts. For example, we model
everything as resources with property values and do not stray from that
model. Keeping things simple also means building on established and
well-known specifications, but also carefully limiting the number of
other specifications that we reference. This simplicity is intended to
enable loose coupling and to make life easier for everybody: OSLC domain
work groups, OSLC Service implementers and OSLC client developers.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodate different schemas</strong>. Because of the breadth of the OSLC
domains, spanning lifecycle and platforms, OSLC has to work for systems
with very different data schemas or no schemas at all. Flexibility is
needed, but some OSLC Services must be able to offer information about
resource properties so that clients can learn which are allowed and
required for resource creation, query and reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodate different representations</strong>. Different client platforms
might require or at least prefer different representations. For example,
in the browser a JSON or Atom format representation might work best.
OSLC Services will all support RDF/XML and may support other formats
including JSON, Atom and Turtle.</p>
<p><strong>Align with the W3C Linked Data initiative</strong>. Instead of defining a new
data model, OSLC’s resource and property-value approach is based on
industry standard Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model. This
model allows OSLC to keep things simple, build on the WWW and
accommodate different schemas.</p>
<h2 id="glossary-of-terms">Glossary of terms</h2>
<p>This is a guide to some of the terminology used in this document. The
following definitions are standard W3C concepts. OSLC uses these
concepts without modification – their definitions are summarized here
for the convenience of the reader. See <a href="http://www.w3c.org">http://www.w3c.org</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource</strong>: A network data object or service that can be
identified by a URI. Resources may be available in multiple
representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats,
size, resolutions) or vary in other ways. (reference: HTTP)</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Representation</strong>: An HTTP payload entity, included in an HTTP
response, that is subject to content negotiation. There may exist
multiple representations. associated with a particular HTTP
response status. (reference: HTTP)</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>URI</strong>: Uniform Resource Identifiers are simply formatted strings
which identify&ndash;via name, location, or any other characteristic &ndash; a
resource (reference: URI Syntax)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the OSLC specific terms used in this specification.</p>
<p>(these definitions are normative)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Domain</strong>: an OSLC Domain is one ALM or PLM topic area such as
Change Management, Requirements management or Automation. Each OSLC
Domain will have its own OSLC specification that complies with this
Core specification.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Service</strong>: a set of capabilities that enable a web client to
create, retrieve, update and delete resources managed by an ALM or
PLM product or online service offering and associated with one
OSLC Domain.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Service Provider</strong>: a product or online service offering that
provides an implementation of one or more OSLC Services, which may
themselves implement different OSLC Domain specifications.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Resource</strong>: a resource that is managed by an OSLC Service,
may have properties and may link to other resources including those
provided by other OSLC Services.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Defined Resource</strong>: a resource that is defined by an OSLC
specification, see OSLC Defined Resources below.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Defined Properties</strong>: resource properties that are defined by
an OSLC specification, defined by an OSLC Resource Shape or both.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Resource Shape</strong>: defines the set of OSLC Properties expected
in a resource for specific operations (i.e. creation, update
or query) for each their value types, allowed values, cardinality
and optionality. Examples of such operations include OSLC Creation
Resource and Query Resource. Other examples might include
applications that display data in tables.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Creation Factory</strong>. A creation factory provides a URI used to
create new resources via HTTP POST and may also provide Resource
Shapes that describe the types of resources that may be created.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Query</strong> <strong>Capability</strong>: A query capability provides a base
URI for forming query resource URIs and, optionally, Resource Shapes
that describe the property values that may be used in query
expressions and returned in query results.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>OSLC Response Info Resource</strong>: An OSLC Defined Resource that
provides information about a paged resource representation, e.g. the
next page in a multi-page query result representation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some industry terms that we use in this specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)</strong>: ALM is the marriage of
business management to software engineering made possible by tools
that facilitate and integrate requirements management, architecture,
coding, testing, tracking, and release management
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)</strong>: In industry, product
lifecycle management (PLM) is the process of managing the entire
lifecycle of a product from its conception, through design and
manufacture, to service and disposal (from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle_management">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle_management</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, we use the following two terms to describe portions of the
OSLC Core specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normative</strong>. Normative sections of this document set forth
requirements that must be met to establish conformance with the OSLC
Core specification; or providing recommendations or optional courses
of action. This is done using use words from
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a> (e.g. MUST, SHOULD,
MAY, etc.). For recommended or optional features, conformance is not
dependent on the fact of implementation, but, if implemented, that
implementation is as prescribed in this specification. Contrast
with informative.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Informative</strong>. Informative text provides background
or explanation. Contrast with Normative. It should be clear which
sentences and paragraphs are informative from the context and the
absence of RFC-2119 keywords. Sections that are purely informative
will be marked as informative. Informative text that might be
mistaken for normative will also be marked.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="oslc-defined-resources">OSLC Defined Resources</h1>
<p>An OSLC Resource is a resource managed by an OSLC Service. An OSLC
Resource is typically something like a Change Request, a Requirement or
some other ALM or PLM artifact or record, but an OSLC Resource could
also be a video or a presentation file. The resource’s storage medium is
unconstrained by OSLC, e.g. it could be stored in a relational database,
a flat-file on disk, a source code control system, or in any other way.</p>
<p>An OSLC Service can manage any type of resource; OSLC specifications
only constrain an OSLC Service’s behavior with respect to resource types
it manages that are defined by OSLC specifications (OSLC Defined
Resources). OSLC Defined Resources may be specified in any OSLC
specification, including this document. Resources are defined by the
properties that are allowed and required in the resource.</p>
<h2 id="oslc-defined-resources-1">OSLC Defined Resources</h2>
<p>OSLC uses a simple model of resources with property values intended to
be consistent with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model
(reference: RDF Concepts). OSLC also builds upon the Extensible Markup
Language (XML) namespace mechanism (reference: XML Namespaces).</p>
<p>When specifying a resource or a property, OSLC Specifications define its
type as a URI which can be decomposed into a namespace URI and a name.
We abbreviate type URIs as Prefixed Names (reference: Prefixed Names),
which are represented in XML as QNames. The namespace used for resources
defined in this specification is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Namespace URI: <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#</code></li>
<li>Default Prefix: <code>oslc</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When defining an OSLC Resource type, OSLC Specifications <strong>MUST</strong>
provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> (String): name of the resource which <strong>MUST</strong> be valid as
the Local Name part of a QName (reference: XML Namespaces).</li>
<li><strong>URI</strong> (URI): The URI of the resource definition. Per the rules of
Prefixed Names, this URI is formed by appending the Name to the end
of the Namespace URI in the specification that defines the resource.
For example, the resource named Service (defined below) gets the
Type URI of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#Service</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a resource type is defined, its allowed and required properties can
be defined.</p>
<p>Regardless of any property definitions, providers and clients MAY impose
implementation-specific limits on resources they accept. For example,
they are not required to accept/create/store resources whose RDF triples
contain objects with arbitrarily large literal values.</p>
<h3 id="defining-oslc-properties">Defining OSLC Properties</h3>
<p>OSLC Specifications <strong>MAY</strong> provide a list of properties allowed and/or
required for a particular domain and operation on an OSLC Defined
Resource; if no operation is specified, then the list &lt;br
/&gt;applies to all operations governed by that specification.
Specifications that provide a list of properties and constraints on them
<strong>SHOULD</strong> provide the following information for each property that they
define.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: name of the property which <strong>MUST</strong> be valid as the Local
Name part of a QName (reference: XML Namespaces).</li>
<li><strong>URI</strong>: The URI that identifies the property. The URI is formed by
appending the Name to the end of the Namespace URI associated with
the property. For example, the resource named
<code>oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog</code> (defined below in the Service
Providers Section) defines a property named <code>domain</code> with the URI of
<code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#domain</code></li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Description of the property.</li>
<li><strong>Occurs</strong>: value <strong>MUST</strong> be one of:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#Exactly-one"> <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#Exactly-one</code>
</a></li>
<li><a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-one"> <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-one</code>
</a></li>
<li><a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-many"> <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-many</code>
</a></li>
<li><a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#One-or-many"> <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#One-or-many</code>
</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Value-types</strong>: A property <strong>MAY</strong> allow multiple value-types and a
value <strong>MUST</strong> satisfy one or more of them. Each value-type <strong>MUST</strong>
be a URI that corresponds to one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Literal value-types:
<ul>
<li><strong>Boolean</strong>: a boolean type as specified by XSD Boolean (
<code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean</code>, reference:
XSD Datatypes).</li>
<li><strong>DateTime</strong>: a Date and Time type as specified by XSD
dateTime ( <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime</code>,
reference: XSD Datatypes).</li>
<li><strong>Decimal</strong>: a decimal number type as specified by XSD
Decimal ( <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal</code>,
reference: XSD Datatypes).</li>
<li><strong>Double</strong>: a double floating-point number type as specified
by XSD Double ( <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double</code>,
reference: XSD Datatypes).</li>
<li><strong>Float</strong>: a floating-point number type as specified by XSD
Float ( <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float</code>, reference:
XSD Datatypes).</li>
<li><strong>Integer:</strong> an integer number type as specified by XSD
Integer ( <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer</code>,
reference: XSD Datatypes).</li>
<li><strong>String</strong>: a string type as specified by XSD String (
<code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string</code>, reference:
XSD Datatypes).</li>
<li><strong>XMLLiteral</strong>: a Literal XML value ( <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral">
<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral</code>
</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resource value-types:
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource</strong>: value is a resource at a specified URI (i.e. a
URI Reference) ( <a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#Resource">
<code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#Resource</code>
</a> ).</li>
<li><strong>Local Resource</strong>: value is an resource available only
inside the resource being defined (i.e. a Blank Node) ( <a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#LocalResource">
<code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#LocalResource</code>
</a> ).</li>
<li><strong>AnyResource</strong>: value is either a <strong>Resource</strong> or <strong>Local
Resource</strong> as defined above ( <a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#AnyResource">
<code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#AnyResource</code>
</a> ).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Representation</strong>: for properties with a resource value-type, OSLC
specifications should also specify how the resource will
be represented. The options are <a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#Reference">
<code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#Reference</code>
</a> , <a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#Inline">
<code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#Inline</code>
</a> or <a href="http://open-services.net/ns/core#Either">
<code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#Either</code>
</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: for properties with a resource value-type, OSLC
specifications should follow the best practices in <a href="OslcCoreSpecAppendixLinks">Appendix C
Guidance on Links and Relationships</a>,
which usually results in no restrictions on the range of possible
resource types allowed, and an informative recommendation in the
property description suggesting which resource types implementations
should expect to find. This can be specified as a list of one or
more resource types specified by URI reference; when no restrictions
are required, use the string any. Clients SHOULD allow any resource
type as the target of a link. Providers are strongly <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong>
to behave reasonably for all resource types listed in a property’s
description, and to degrade gracefully for others, as defined in
Appendix C.</li>
<li><strong>Read-only</strong>: Boolean indication of whether or not clients are
permitted to replace the property’s value after the resource has
been created. Allowable values are: true, false, unspecified.
<ul>
<li><strong>True</strong> indicates that providers <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> permit clients
to change the property’s value after the resource has
been created.</li>
<li><strong>False</strong> indicates that providers <strong>MAY</strong> permit clients to
change the property’s value after the resource has been created.</li>
<li><strong>Unspecified</strong> indicates that the domain specification leaves
the choice up to provider implementations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the rest of this document we will define OSLC resources as described
above. The below section titled OSLC Defined Resource Representations
defines how OSLC resources are to be represented in RDF/XML, JSON and
other formats.</p>
<p>OSLC Services that wish to provide the information above in a
machine-readable format <strong>MAY</strong> use OSLC Resource Shapes, see [Appendix
A: Common Properties and Resources](OSLC Core Spec Appendix A) for more
information.</p>
<p>NOTE: we do not mention Internationalization of strings here because we
expect standard HTTP content-negotiation and representation (e.g.
<code>xml:lang</code>) mechanisms to be used for such.</p>
<h2 id="unknown-properties-and-content">Unknown properties and content</h2>
<p>For OSLC Defined Resources, clients <strong>SHOULD</strong> assume that an OSLC
Service will discard unknown property values. An OSLC Service <strong>MAY</strong>
discard property values that are not part of the resource definition or
Resource Shape known by the server. If a client needs verification that
the requested update was accepted it <strong>SHOULD</strong> note the HTTP response
header ETag value returned with the HTTP PUT, Immediately HTTP GET the
resource back and compare the HTTP response header ETag value and
contents with its expectations. The Service <strong>SHOULD</strong> <strong>NOT</strong> return an
error code for unrecognized content. A Service <strong>MUST</strong> return an error
code if recognized content is invalid.</p>
<p>The rule is different for clients. When doing an update, OSLC clients
<strong>MUST</strong> preserve any unknown property-values and other content in OSLC
Defined Resources.</p>
<p>See following section on Resource Update.</p>
<h2 id="resource-operations">Resource Operations</h2>
<p>OSLC Services use HTTP for create, retrieve, update and delete
operations on resources. OSLC Services <strong>MUST</strong> comply with the HTTP
specification (reference: HTTP).</p>
<h3 id="resource-creation">Resource Creation</h3>
<p>(this section is informative)</p>
<p>To create an OSLC Defined Resource, or any type of resource managed by
an OSLC Service, an OSLC client HTTP POSTs a representation of that
resource to a Creation URI. See the section on <a href="#Creation_Factories">Creation
Factories</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="resource-removal">Resource Removal</h3>
<p>(this section is informative)</p>
<p>To delete an OSLC Defined Resource, or any type of resource managed by a
service, a client performs an HTTP DELETE on the resource&rsquo;s URI.</p>
<h3 id="resource-update">Resource Update</h3>
<p>To update an OSLC Resource in an OSLC Service, a client fetches a
representation of that resource via HTTP GET. The client updates the
representation and then uses HTTP PUT to send the new representation to
the resource&rsquo;s URI.</p>
<p>Recall from <a href="#Unknown_properties_and_content">OSLC Defined Resources: Unknown properties and
content</a> above that, when doing an
update, OSLC clients must preserve any unknown property-values and other
content in OSLC Defined Resources.</p>
<p>Because the update process involves first getting a resource, modifying
it and then later putting it back to the server there is the possibility
of a conflict, e.g. some other client may have have updated the resource
since the GET. To mitigate this problem, OSLC Services <strong>SHOULD</strong> use
the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is missing OSLC Services <strong>SHOULD</strong>
return HTTP Bad Request (400) status code to indicate that the
header is required.</li>
<li>If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is present OSLC Services <strong>MUST</strong>
behave as described in the HTTP specification, returning an HTTP
Precondition Failed (412) error to indicate that the header does
not match.</li>
<li>If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is present and it matches, but there
is some other problem or conflict with the update then OSLC Services
<strong>MAY</strong> return an HTTP Conflict (409) to indicate that problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that section <a href="#Error_Responses">Error Responses</a> below, we specify
that when an error occurs and useful information can be provided to
clients OSLC Services <strong>SHOULD</strong> return error information in the body of
the response.</p>
<h2 id="resource-paging">Resource Paging</h2>
<p>OSLC Services <strong>MAY</strong> support a technique called Resource Paging to
enable clients to retrieve resources one page at a time.</p>
<p>When a client requests a resource, the client can expect that the entire
resource will be returned in the response, with all property values.
This can be problematic because, in some cases, resources may be so
large that a client might not want to retrieve the entire resource in
one HTTP response.</p>
<p>One solution for response size-sensitive Clients is to check size before
loading. Clients that do not wish to load large resources can use the
HTTP HEAD method to determine the size of a resource and, according to
the rules of HTTP the server&rsquo;s <strong>SHOULD</strong> include an HTTP Content-Length
header that indicates the size of the resource as the &ldquo;decimal number of
OCTETs.&rdquo; If the size is too large, a client can choose not to retrieve
the resource.</p>
<p>Another solution is to use Resource Paging; here&rsquo;s how it works. To get
a paged version of a resource, a client adds the
&ldquo;key<code>value&quot; pair =oslc.paging=true</code> to the query component of the
resource URI and the server <strong>MAY</strong> respond by returning a
representation that contains partial information about the resource;
only a subset of the resource&rsquo;s property values.</p>
<p>When a page is returned and it is <strong>NOT</strong> the last page in the sequence,
then it <strong>SHOULD</strong> include an <code>oslc:ResponseInfo</code> (defined below), which
that contains a resource-valued property <code>oslc:nextPage</code> that links to a
resource that represents the next page of property-values. Because
paging is unstable (see below), by the time a client follows an
<code>oslc:nextPage</code> link there may no longe be a next page, in this case the
server <strong>MAY</strong> respond with an HTTP 404 Page Not Found status code.</p>
<p>A client can also request paging by adding the
&ldquo;key<code>value&quot; pair =oslc.pageSize</code> to the query string component of the
resource URI. By adding this, a client requests that the server respond
with a specific number of property values. For example,
<code>oslc.pageSize=20</code> indicates to the server that the client would like 20
values per page. OSLC Services <strong>MAY</strong> ignore <code>oslc.pageSize</code>.</p>
<p>When Resource Paging is used, the values of a multi-valued property
<strong>MAY</strong> be split across resource pages. Each property value <strong>MUST</strong> be
represented in its entirety and not split across multiple partial
resource pages.</p>
<h3 id="provider-response-size-limitations">Provider response-size limitations</h3>
<p>When a client requests a resource that an OSLC Service considers to be
too large to return in one response and the client has not indicated
that it desires paging (via oslc.paging or oslc.pageSize), the OSLC
Service <strong>MAY</strong> redirect the client to a representation that contains
partial information about the resource, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The OSLC Service receives an HTTP GET request for a resource that
exceeds size limits and URL does not include <code>oslc.paging</code> or an
<code>oslc.pageSize</code> key/value pair.</li>
<li>The OSLC Service returns an HTTP Status 302 redirect a URL that does
include the key/values for paging, as follows:
<ul>
<li>If the client did not indicate paging, the new redirect URL
<strong>MUST</strong> include the <code>oslc.paging</code> pair.</li>
<li>If the client indicated a page size, then the redirect URL
<strong>MUST</strong> include the <code>oslc.pageSize</code> pair with a size value that
is acceptable to the service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The client <strong>MAY</strong> choose to follow the redirect and receive a
representation that contains partial information about the resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>On receiving a resource representation, OSLC Clients <strong>SHOULD</strong> check
for the presence of an <code>oslc:nextPage</code> value to determine if the
representation contains partial information about the resource. If the
value is present, then paging is in effect and the representation
contains partial information about the resource.</p>
<h3 id="unstable-paging">Unstable Paging</h3>
<p>Because HTTP is a stateless protocol and OSLC Services manage resources
that can change frequently, OSLC clients <strong>SHOULD</strong> assume that
resources can change as they page through them using the <code>oslc:nextPage</code>
mechanism.</p>
<h3 id="stable-paging">Stable Paging</h3>
<p>Some OSLC Services might wish to guarantee stable paging, meaning that
the chain of <code>oslc:nextPage</code> links in a resource represent a snapshot in
time and will not change as the client pages through them. OSLC
specifications that require stable paging <strong>SHOULD</strong> state this
requirement and specify to which resources it applies.</p>
<p>Note that because stable paging implementations are based on server-side
state, it is possible that such state will expire. Implementations
<strong>MAY</strong> use the HTTP response code 410 (Expired) to indicate to clients
that the next-page link they requested has expired.</p>
<h3 id="response-information">Response Information</h3>
<p>Resource representations returned via Resource Paging <strong>MUST</strong> include a
resource of type <code>oslc:ResponseInfo</code>, as defined in this section. A
response info resource representation describes information about a
paged HTTP response body in which it appears.</p>

<p>The subject resource URI of the <code>oslc:ResponseInfo</code> resource
representation will be the HTTP request URI, or URI from subsequent

subject resources different from the one identified by the request URI.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example, using the OSLC Core RDF/XML representation guidance,
that illustrates how the <code>oslc:ResponseInfo</code> resource representation is
included in addition to the blog entry resource representation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Refer to the OSLC Defined Resource Representation guidance for an
explanation of how the response info resource may be represented in
RDF/XML.</p>
<h2 id="selective-property-values">Selective Property Values</h2>
<p>OSLC Services <strong>MAY</strong> support a technique called Selective Properties to
enable clients to retrieve only selected property values.</p>
<p>By adding the key<code>value pair =oslc.properties</code>, specified below, to a
resource URI, a client can request a new resource with a subset of the
original resource&rsquo;s values. Here&rsquo;s how the selective properties values
<code>oslc.properties</code> and <code>oslc.prefix</code> work.</p>
<h3 id="oslcproperties">oslc.properties</h3>
<p>The <code>oslc.properties</code> key=value pair lets you specify the set of
properties to be included in the response. Both immediate and nested
properties may be specified. A nested property is a property that
belongs to the resource referenced by another property. Nested
properties are enclosed in brace brackets, and this nesting may be done
recursively, i.e. a nested property may contain other nested properties.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have a bug report resource at the following URL:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code> http://example.com/bugs/4242
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose this bug resource has properties such as <code>dcterms:title</code>,
<code>dcterms:description</code>, and <code>dcterms:creator</code>, and that <code>dcterms:creator</code>
refers to a person resource that has properties such as <code>foaf:givenName</code>
and <code>foaf:familyName</code>. Suppose you want a representation of the bug
report that includes its <code>dcterms:title</code> and the <code>foaf:givenName</code> and
<code>foaf:familyName</code> of the person refered to by its <code>dcterms:creator</code>. The
following URL illustrates the use of the <code>oslc.properties</code> query value
to include those properties:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>http://example.com/bugs/4242?oslc.properties=dcterms:title,dcterms:creator{foaf:givenName,foaf:familyName}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p>The <code>oslc.properties</code> pair is defined by the <code>oslc_properties</code> term in
the following BNF grammar:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>oslc_properties ::= &quot;oslc.properties=&quot; properties
properties      ::= property (&quot;,&quot; property)*
property        ::= identifier | wildcard | nested_prop
nested_prop     ::= (identifier | wildcard) &quot;{&quot; properties &quot;}&quot;
wildcard        ::= &quot;*&quot;
identifier      ::= PrefixedName
PrefixedName    ::= /* see &quot;SPARQL Query Lanaguage for RDF&quot;, http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#rPrefixedName */
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="oslcprefix">oslc.prefix</h3>
<p>In our examples of <code>oslc.properties</code>, property names include a URI
prefix, i.e. <code>dcterms:</code> or <code>foaf:</code>. An OSLC Service <strong>SHOULD</strong> predefine
URI prefixes for its properties. Here we assume that OSLC has predefined
the Dublin Core ( <code>dcterms:</code>) and Friend of a Friend ( <code>foaf:</code>)
prefixes. However, OSLC resources <strong>SHOULD</strong> also be open to new
content, which means that new properties may not have predefined URI
prefixes. We therefore need a way to define new URI prefixes in resource
requests. The <code>oslc.prefix</code> value lets you specify URI prefixes used in
property names. For example, suppose the <code>foaf:</code> prefix was not
predefined. The following URL illustrates the use of the <code>oslc.prefix</code>
value to define it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>http://example.com/bugs/4242?oslc.prefix=foaf=&lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;&amp;oslc.properties=foaf:lastName,...
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p>The syntax of the <code>oslc.prefix</code> is defined by the <code>oslc_prefix</code> term in
the following BNF grammar:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>oslc_prefix ::= &quot;oslc.prefix=&quot; prefix_defs
prefix_defs ::= prefix_def (&quot;,&quot; prefix_def)*
prefix_def  ::= prefix &quot;=&quot; uri_ref_esc
prefix      ::= PN_PREFIX
PN_PREFIX   ::= /* see &quot;SPARQL Query Lanaguage for RDF&quot;, http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#rPN_PREFIX */
uri_ref_esc ::= /* an angle bracket-delimited URI reference in which &gt; and \ are \-escaped. */
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="common-properties">Common Properties</h2>
<p>OSLC domains specifications are strongly encouraged to use the common
properties approved by the OSLC Core Workgroup (See
[OSLC Core Spec Appendix A](OSLC Core Spec Appendix A)) rather than
defining new properties.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="service-provider-resources">Service Provider Resources</h1>
<p>OSLC Services are accessible via a Service Provider Resource that
describes each service, which domain specifications the service
implements as well as the creation, query and delegated UI capabilities
of each service.</p>
<p>Additionally, a provider may offer a Service Provider Catalog that lists
related Service Providers.</p>
<h2 id="conceptual-model">Conceptual Model</h2>
<p>The conceptual model of Service Provider Catalog and Service Provider
resources is simple. They are both resources with property values. The
values allowed and required in each type of resource are defined below.</p>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the Service Provider Catalog and Service
Provider concepts and relationships. As you can see there are two
Resources defined: Service Provider Catalog and Service Provider. There
are also a set of Local In-Line Resources that are used inside the
Resources to define namespaces, OAuth configurations, contributors as
well as services and their capabilities.</p>

Provider resources.</p>
<h3 id="resource-service-provider-catalog">Resource: Service Provider Catalog</h3>

<p>The next sections cover the Creation Factory and Query Capability in
more detail.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="creation-factories">Creation Factories</h1>
<p>An OSLC Service can provide one or more creation factory to enable the
creation of new resources. A creation factory provides a Creation URI
used to create new resources via HTTP POST and may also provide Resource
Shapes that describe the types of resources that may be created. To
create a new OSLC Resource, an OSLC client POSTs a representation of
that resource to a Creation Factory&rsquo;s Creation URI.</p>
<ul>
<li>An HTTP POST of content to a Creation URI <strong>SHOULD</strong> result in the
creation of a new resource or an explanation of why creation did not
occur via the appropriate HTTP status code.</li>
<li>The response to a successful HTTP POST of content to a Creation URI
<strong>SHOULD</strong> include a HTTP Location header that specifies the URI of
the newly created resource.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-an-oslc-defined-resource">Creating an OSLC Defined Resource</h2>
<p>To create an OSLC Defined Resource, an OSLC Client first forms an
representation of that resource including the desired and required
property values. A client can learn what properties are allowed in a new
OSLC Defined Resource via the OSLC specification that defines or, in
some cases via a Resource Shape resource. Next the client uses HTTP POST
to post that representation to a Creation URI.</p>
<ul>
<li>The response to a successful HTTP POST of a representation to a
Creation Resource URI <strong>MAY</strong> include a representation of the newly
created resource.</li>
<li>The resource returned <strong>MAY</strong> contain changes to properties made by
the server or new properties added by the server.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="query-capabilities">Query Capabilities</h1>
<p>An OSLC Service may provide one or more Query Capabilities to enable
query of resources. A Query Capability provides a base URI for forming
Query Resource URIs and <strong>MAY</strong> provide Resource Shapes that describe
the property values that may be expected in the resources that are
queryable via the query capability. Thus, Query Capabilities provide a
way to discover the resources managed by an OSLC Service.</p>
<p>In a Query Capability, the base URI, as defined by the <code>oslc:queryBase</code>
property, is itself a resource managed by the service and it acts as the
starting subject resource for the queries based on it. Since the list
may contain hundreds of thousands of members, queries are used to filter
the list for members that satisfy certain conditions, e.g. the bugs that
have high priority and were created this week.</p>
<h2 id="conceptual-model-1">Conceptual Model</h2>
<p>To perform a query an OSLC client first creates a URI by starting with a
Query Capability&rsquo;s base URI as a base and adding a URI Query String to
express the query criteria. The OSLC client then uses HTTP GET to
request a Query Resource representation of the query results. The Query
Resource representation will contain property values about the query and
a collection of resources that match the query criteria.</p>
<h4 id="http-get-queries">HTTP GET Queries</h4>
<p>To perform an HTTP GET query, an OSLC client starts with the base URI as
defined by the <code>oslc:queryBase</code> property of a Query Capability, and
appends to it query parameters in a syntax supported by the service. The
resulting URI is the query URI. The OSLC client sends an HTTP GET
request to the query URI, optionally specifying the preferred content
media type for the query response in the HTTP Accept header. OSLC
Services <strong>MUST</strong> support query responses in RDF/XML format (media type
<code>application/rdf+xml</code>) and <strong>MAY</strong> support other formats. OSLC Services
<strong>SHOULD</strong> support the Query Syntax defined in this specification, but
<strong>MAY</strong> support other syntaxes.</p>
<h2 id="query-syntax">Query Syntax</h2>
<p>A query URI can be formed by adding a query string to the end of the
Query Capability&rsquo;s base URI (or by sending the query string in the
request body when using HTTP POST). The syntax used to express the query
criteria in that string is specified by each OSLC domain specification.</p>
<p>The <a href="OSLCCoreSpecQuery">OSLC Core Spec Query Specification</a> document
defines a standard set of OSLC query parameters that other OSLC domain
specifications <strong>MAY</strong> use to query resources.</p>
<h3 id="query-specification-errors">Query Specification errors</h3>
<p>If there is an error in the specification of the query, whether the
query is specified by key=value pairs in the HTTP GET URL or key=value
pairs in the body of an HTTP POST, then the provider <strong>MUST</strong> respond
with an error. The error response should be an HTTP 400 Bad Request
error and an explanation of the error in the OSLC Error Response format
(see Error Responses below).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="delegated-user-interface-dialogs">Delegated User Interface Dialogs</h1>
<p>OSLC specifications target specific integration scenarios. In some
cases, allowing one product to delegate to a user interface defined in
another product is a more effective way to support a use case than an
HTTP interface that can only be accessed programmatically. There are two
cases where this is especially true:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource creation</strong>: when a user of a web application needs to
create a new resource in an OSLC Service Provider. In this case the
web application asks the service provider to provide a UI for
resource creation and the provider notifies the application when the
creation has been completed or canceled by the user.</li>
<li><strong>Resource selection</strong>: when a user of a web application and needs
to pick a resource managed by a OSLC Service Provider. In this case
the web application asks the service provider to provide a UI for
resource selection and the provider notifies the application when a
resource or resources has been selected or if the selection
was canceled.</li>
</ul>
<p>To support these two cases, below we define OSLC Delegated User
Interface (UI) Dialogs. Delegated UI Dialogs are a technique where one
provider can embed a creation or selection UI into another using a
combination of an HTML &lt;iframe&gt; and JavaScript code. The diagram
below illustrates how delegated UI dialogs work in a scenario where
Provider A wants to allow a user to select or create a resource managed
by Provider B.</p>
<p><strong>Figure #3: Delegated UI Dialog interactions</strong></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Next, the details of the Delegated UI Dialog protocol.</p>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p>The following terms are used in discussions of Delegated UI Dialogs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI Consumer</strong> - a web application that is embedding a Delegated UI
Dialog from an OSLC Service Provider. This consumer could be a web
page, with the Delegated UI Dialog loaded into an iframe or a native
application, e.g. an IDE like Eclipse, that is embedding a web
browser component.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>UI Provider</strong> - an OSLC Service provider that offers one or more
Delegated UI Dialogs. These dialogs will be specified in the
provider&rsquo;s Service Provider resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next sections explain how Delegated UI Dialogs work.</p>
<h2 id="post-message-and-window-name-protocols">Post Message and Window Name protocols</h2>
<p>To support the widest range of web browsers, we define two different
protocols for communicating the information about the user&rsquo;s action from
the UI Provider and back to the UI Consumer. These are the Post Message
and Window Name protocols described below.</p>
<p>In both the Post Message and Window Name protocols, the way that a UI
Consumer includes a Delegated UI Dialog in an HTML page is to create an
<code>iframe</code> and specify the <code>src</code> as the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog to
be included. The UI Consumer indicates the protocol to be used by
appending one of the two fragment identifiers below to the URI:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#oslc-core-postMessage-1.0</code> - Indicates that the Post Message
protocol is to be used</li>
<li><code>#oslc-core-windowName-1.0</code> - Indicates that the Window Name
protocol is to be used</li>
</ul>
<p>The JavaScript code example below shows now a UI Provider can determine
which protocol is in use:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>    if (window.location.hash == '#oslc-core-windowName-1.0') {
        // Window Name protocol in use
    } else if (window.location.hash == '#oslc-core-postMessage-1.0') {
        // Post Message protocol in use
    }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="iframe-creation-considerations">iframe Creation Considerations</h4>
<p>Regardless of the protocol in effect, it is recommended that UI
Consumers follow the below iframe creation guidelines to provide a more
seamless user experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embed the <code>iframe</code> within a <code>div</code> element, with height and width set
based on the relative length values specified in the Service
Resource that declares the Delegated UI Dialog.</li>
<li>Set the <code>iframe</code> border size to &lsquo;0&rsquo;</li>
<li>Set the <code>iframe</code> scrolling to &lsquo;auto&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, the details for each of the two protocols.</p>
<h3 id="post-message-protocol">Post Message Protocol</h3>
<p>The Post Message protocol relies on the HTML5 function
<code>window.postMessage()</code> (reference: HTML5), available in the latest or
pending releases of most browsers. UI Consumers must anticipate other,
unrelated uses of postMessage(), and should ignore messages not
conforming to this protocol.</p>
<p>Typically, the embedded page will be loaded in a window inside another
window, such as a iframe inside some surrounding webpage. In such cases,
<code>postMessage()</code> must be called on that parent window. But in a native
application, an outer page is not needed and the embedded page may be
shown directly in the browser&rsquo;s &ldquo;root&rdquo; window. When the embedded page
has no parent window, it must call <code>postMessage()</code> on its own window.</p>
<p>Here are the responsibilities of the UI Consumer and UI Provider in Post
Message protocol.</p>
<h4 id="the-ui-consumers-responsibilities">The UI Consumer&rsquo;s responsibilities</h4>
<p>1 Include the Delegated UI Dialog via iframe (i.e setting iframe src to
the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog) or via an embedded browser. Append
the fragment identifier #oslc-core-postMessage-1.0 to the URL to
indicate that Post Message is the desired protocol. 1 Add a &lsquo;message&rsquo;
listener to the outer window to receive messages from the Delegated UI
Dialog. 1 Listen for window &lsquo;message&rsquo; events, ignoring events from other
sources or not prefixed with &ldquo;oslc-response:&rdquo; 1 When message from
Delegated UI Dialog indicates user completed action, free resources and
handle action.</p>
<h4 id="the-ui-providers-responsibilities">The UI Provider&rsquo;s responsibilities</h4>
<p>1 Provide Delegated UI Dialog, an HTML page that provides a user
interface for resource creation or selection. 1 Allow the user to
perform resource creation or selection. 1 Once the user has created,
selected or canceled, send notification using <code>postMessage()</code> to the
page&rsquo;s parent window, passed in <code>event.data</code> string, that is prefixed
with &ldquo;oslc-response:&rdquo; See below for the two possible response formats,
one for resource selection and one for creation. 1 If the page is not
parented, then the message is posted to the page&rsquo;s own window. The page
must ignore this message to itself.</p>
<p>The below JavaScript code example shows how a UI Provider page would
send a response using <code>postMessage()</code> and taking into account the fact
that some pages are not parented.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>   function respondWithPostMessage(/*string*/ response) {
      (window.parent | window).postMessage(&quot;oslc-response:&quot; + response, &quot;*&quot;);
   }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the Window Name protocol.</p>
<h3 id="window-name-protocol">Window Name Protocol</h3>
<p>The Window Name protocol uses the HTML DOM <code>window.name</code> property to
communicate the response (reference: Window Object) from the UI Provider
to the UI Consumer. This special property of window maintains its value
even as the window navigates to a different origin, but the ifame&rsquo;s
<code>window.name</code> can only be read when the accessing window shares the same
origin. For this to happen, when the embedded page is finished it must
set the <code>window.name</code> and also change the <code>window.location</code> to a page
with the same origin as the outer frame. This not only allows the UI
Consumer to access the result, but also fires an event telling the UI
Consumer when to do so. This return location is passed to the embedded
page using the <code>window.name</code> property.</p>
<p>Here are the responsibilities of the UI Consumer and UI Provider in
Window Name protocol.</p>
<h4 id="the-ui-consumers-responsibilities-1">The UI Consumer&rsquo;s responsibilities</h4>
<p>1 Include the Delegated UI Dialog via iframe (i.e setting iframe src to
the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog) or via an embedded browser. Append
the fragment identifier #oslc-core-windowName-1.0 to the URL to
indicate that Window Name is the desired protocol. 1 On the iframe, set
the frame&rsquo;s <code>window.name</code> to indicate the Return URL. 1 On the iframe,
Listen for &lsquo;onload&rsquo; events 1 When an &lsquo;onload&rsquo; event occures an the
frame&rsquo;s location is equal to the Return URL then read the response from
the window.name.</p>
<p>The following Javascript code illustrates the protocol. The code for the
<code>destroyFrame()</code>, <code>handleMessage()</code> and <code>displayFrame()</code> methods are not
provided in this example, but should be obvious to a JavaScript
developer. The UI Consumer must provide these methods.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>    var pickerURL = ... // URL of Provider's Delegated UI Dialog
    var returnURL = ... // Consumer's Return URL

    var frame = document.createElement('iframe');

   function windowNameProtocol() {

      // Step #1: create iframe with fragment to indicate protocol
      // Step #2: set the iframe's window.name to indicate the Return URL
      if (ie &gt; 0) {
         frame = document.createElement('&lt;iframe name=\'' + returnURL + '\'&gt;');
      } else {
         frame = document.createElement('iframe');
         frame.name = returnURL;
      }
      frame.src = pickerURL + '#oslc-core-windowName-1.0';
      frame.width = 450;
      frame.height = 300;

      displayFrame(frame);

      // Step #3: listen for onload events on the iframe
      var ie = window.navigator.userAgent.indexOf(&quot;MSIE&quot;);
      if (ie &gt; 0) {
         frame.attachEvent(&quot;onLoad&quot;, onFrameLoaded);
      } else {
         frame.onload = onFrameLoaded;
      }
   }

   function onFrameLoaded() {
      try { // May throw an exception if the frame's location is still a different origin

         // Step #4: when frame's location is equal to the Return URL
         // then read response and return.
         if (frame.contentWindow.location == returnURL) {
            var message = frame.contentWindow.name;
            destroyFrame(frame);
            handleMessage(message);
         }

      } catch (e) {
         // ignore: access exception when trying to access window name
      }
   }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-ui-providers-responsibilities-1">The UI Provider&rsquo;s responsibilities</h4>
<p>As soon as the embedded page has loaded, perform the following:</p>
<p>1 <em>Provide Delegated UI Dialog, an HTML page that provides a user
interface for resource creation or selection.</em> 1 <em>Read the Return URL
from the window.name variable</em> 1 &lt;span style=&ldquo;font-family:
Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small&rdquo;&gt;Allow user to
perform resource creation or selection.&lt;/span&gt; 1 Once user has
created, selected or canceled, communicate the user&rsquo;s response by
setting the window.name variable to the response. See below for the two
possible response formats, one for resource selection and one for
creation. 1 Indicate that user has responded by setting the
window.location to the Return URL specified by the UI Consumer.</p>
<p>The JavaScript example below shows a UI Provider notifying its UI
Consumer after a user has responded.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>function respondWithWindowName(/*string*/ response) {
   // Step #2: read the return URL
   var returnURL = window.name;

   // Step #4: send the response via the window.name variable
   window.name = response;

   // Step #5: indicate that user has responded
   window.location = returnURL;
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="resource-selection">Resource Selection</h2>
<p>Resource Selection can be used when a UI Consumer wants to allow a user
to pick a resource that is managed by an OSLC Service. Using either the
Post Message or Window Name protocols defined above, the UI Consumer
uses an iframe to embed a selection dialog that is provided by the
service, then awaits notification that the user has selected a resource.</p>
<p>To enable Resource Selection, an OSLC Service <strong>MUST</strong> provide in its
Service Resource a value for the <code>oslc:selectionDialog</code> property. The
property value will include a <code>oslc:dialogURI</code> property that indicates
the URI of the selection dialog.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the response from the UI Provider is conveyed to the
UI Consumer, the response <strong>SHOULD</strong> be formatted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name:</strong> <code>results</code></li>

        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="resource-creation-1">Resource Creation</h2>
<p>Resource Creation can be used when a UI Consumer wants to allow a user
to create a new resource that is managed by an OSLC Service. Using
either the Post Message or Window Name protocols defined above, the UI
Consumer uses an iframe to embed a creation dialog that is provided by
the service, then awaits notification that the user has created a
resource.</p>
<p>To enable Resource Creation, an OSLC Service <strong>MUST</strong> provide in its
Service Resource a value for the <code>oslc:creationDialog</code> property. The
property value will include a <code>oslc:dialogURI</code> property that indicates
the URI of the creation dialog.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the response from the UI Provider is conveyed to the
UI Consumer, the response <strong>SHOULD</strong> be formatted as defined by
<code>oslc:results</code></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;oslc:results&quot; : [ {
            &quot;oslc:label&quot;: &quot;Bug 123: Server crash&quot;,
            &quot;rdf:resource&quot;: &quot;http://example.com/bug123&quot;

        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="prefilling-creation-dialogs">Prefilling Creation Dialogs</h3>
<p>Service providers <strong>MAY</strong> support receiving a POST request whose content
body is a resource representation to the Creation Dialog URI to retrieve
a URI that represents the embedded page to be used. Service providers
<strong>MUST</strong> respond with a response status of 201 (Created) with the
response header <code>Location</code> whose value is the URI to request the newly
created form. After some elapsed time, service providers <strong>MAY</strong> respond
with a 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone) or 3xx (Redirect) to an HTTP GET
request for these URIs.</p>
<h2 id="dialog-resizing">Dialog Resizing</h2>
<p>Delegated UI dialogs receive their initial size (dimensions) based on
the <code>oslc:hintWidth</code> and <code>oslc:hintHeight</code> properties described in
<code>oslc:Dialog</code> resource description. There are cases where UI Provider
recognizes that the initial size of a Delegated UI dialog is not
sufficient and needs a way to ask the UI Consumer to resize the dialog.
In this section we specify a mechanism that enables dialog resizing, but
only when Post Message Protocol is used.</p>
<p>Consumers <strong>MAY</strong> honor a dialog&rsquo;s ability to dynamically resize. Those
that do (a) <strong>MUST</strong> use Post Message Protocol, (b) <strong>MUST</strong> use the
<code>oslc:resize</code> value instead of any static width or height, and and (c)
<strong>MUST</strong> register a handler to receive dialog resize messages sent by
the dialog Provider and adjust the size of the dialog accordingly.</p>
<p>Since a dialog is allowed to resize itself any number of times, the
Consumer <strong>MUST</strong> keep a handler registered and react appropriately each
time it received a dialog resize message from that dialog.</p>
<p>UI Providers <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> request sizes larger than 95% of the current
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#viewport">viewport</a>, to avoid
covering the entire viewport with the dialog.</p>
<p>Here are the responsibilities of the UI Consumer and UI Provider in
dialog resizing.</p>
<h3 id="the-ui-consumers-responsibilities-2">The UI Consumer&rsquo;s responsibilities</h3>
<p>1 Include the Delegated UI Dialog via iframe (i.e setting iframe src to

&lsquo;message&rsquo; listener to the outer window to receive messages from the
Delegated UI Dialog. 1 Listen for window &lsquo;message&rsquo; events, ignoring
events from other sources or not prefixed with &ldquo;oslc-resize:&rdquo;. Multiple
resize &lsquo;message&rsquo; events may be sent while the dialog is visible. 1 When
message from Delegated UI Dialog indicates user completed action, free
resources and handle action.</p>
<h3 id="the-ui-providers-responsibilities-2">The UI Provider&rsquo;s responsibilities</h3>
<p>1 Provide Delegated UI Dialog, an HTML page that provides a user
interface for resource creation or selection. 1 Allow the user to
perform resource creation or selection. 1 Once the Provider needs to
resize the dialog, send notification using <code>postMessage()</code> to the page&rsquo;s
parent window, passed in <code>event.data</code> string, that is prefixed with
&ldquo;oslc-resize:&rdquo;. Multiple resize messages may be sent. See below for the
response format. 1 If the page is not parented, then the message is
posted to the page&rsquo;s own window. The page must ignore this message to
itself.</p>
<p>The below JavaScript code example shows how a UI Provider page would
send a response using <code>postMessage()</code> and taking into account the fact
that some pages are not parented.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>   function respondWithPostMessage(/*string*/ resize_response) {

<h1 id="specification-versioning">Specification Versioning</h1>
<p>One of the goals of the OSLC initiative is to mitigate or eliminate the
need for lock-step version upgrades, where clients or services target
one version of a specification and break when new versions are
introduced &ndash; requiring all services to be upgraded simultaneously.</p>
<p>In this section we specify a version header that will enable old
&ldquo;Version 1&rdquo; OSLC clients to continue to work and share the same resource
URIs as used by clients that specifically target the Core. And we
establish rules that will enable clients to continue to work as new
versions of specifications are introduced.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-pre-core-clients">Supporting pre-Core clients</h2>
<p>We anticipate that the OSLC Core and domain specifications will each be
versioned independently and each version will be assigned a version
number, but we would like to avoid exposing version numbers in OSLC
implementations. There is one use case that requires version information
to be exposed. We must ensure that old OSLC &ldquo;Version 1&rdquo; clients continue
to work.</p>
<p>To enable OSLC Service specifications to evolve without breaking
existing clients, we introduce an HTTP Header, <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> set
to the Core specification version number <code>&quot;2.0&quot;</code>. We expect clients that
target the Core to send this HTTP header.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header is present and set to a version
that the service can support, then the service <strong>MUST</strong> return a
representation that is complies with the specified version.</li>
<li>If the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header is present and indicates a
specification version that the service cannot support, the service
<strong>SHOULD</strong> respond with what it determines is the most compatible
version that it can return.</li>
<li>If the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header is not present then the OSLC
Service <strong>SHOULD</strong> respond by returning a resource that conforms to
the earliest or most compatible (as determined by
the implementation) specification version&rsquo;s representation. Services
that never offered an OSLC Version 1 interface can ignore
this restriction.</li>
<li>When returning an OSLC Defined Resource, OSLC Services <strong>MUST</strong>
return the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header set to the Core specification
with which the representation complies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rules-for-new-versions-of-oslc-specifications">Rules for new versions of OSLC specifications</h2>
<p>When specifying a new version of an OSLC specification the rule is this:</p>
<p><strong>A new version of an OSLC specification is not allowed to introduce
changes that will break old clients.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some guidelines for OSLC workgroups defining new specifications
or upgrades to existing ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you believe that you need a property but cannot agree on the
value-type, then this is a strong indication that you should not
attempt to standardize on the property. Once you decide on a
value-type you are stuck with it forever. Wait until you have the
scenarios or implementation experience needed to agree on type.</li>
<li>When introducing a new capability in a new version of a
specification, e.g. a creation factory, query capability or
delegated UI dialog; one that works differently than those specified
in the Core spec or older versions of your own specification, you
should create a new resource type to represent the service. This
will enable old clients to continue to work against old services and
new clients to work with your new capabilities.</li>
<li>When defining resources, do not remove, change the meaning or the
value-type of any properties that you defined in earlier versions of
the specification. You can add new properties but not change those
that already exist.</li>
<li>It is possible to relax restrictions on clients, because relaxing
restrictions should not break clients. But it is not possible to
relax restrictions on services, because clients expect to find the
required fields and if they are missing, clients will break.</li>
<li>Before defining a new property within your OSLC domain&rsquo;s namespace
consult the list of common properties in
[OSLC Core Spec Appendix A](OSLC Core Spec Appendix A) to see if
using a common property would be more appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="migrating-to-the-core-specification">Migrating to the Core Specification</h2>
<p>Most of the first OSLC specifications were developed before this Core
specification existed and do not implement versioning as described above
and so must use some other mechanism to migrate to the OSLC Core v1.0
specification.</p>
<p>OSLC implementations that wish to continue to support old pre-Core OSLC
or OSLC v1.0 specifications can do so by keeping the old implementation
in place and adding the new OSLC Core v1 implementation with different
service provider, query capability and creation factory URIs.</p>

<h1 id="oslc-defined-resource-representations">OSLC Defined Resource Representations</h1>
<p>This section specifies what resource representations are required for
OSLC resources, some requirements for providing representations and some
rational for the requirement that OSLC Services provide RDF/XML
representations.</p>
<p>OSLC resource representations come in many forms and are subject to
standard HTTP mechanisms for content negotiation.</p>
<p>OSLC domain specifications (1) <strong>SHOULD</strong> require the representations
needed for the specific scenarios that they are addressing and (2)
<strong>SHOULD</strong> recognize that different representations are appropriate for
different purposes. For example, browser oriented scenarios might be
best addressed by JSON or Atom format representations. For these
reasons, OSLC Services <strong>MAY</strong> provide and accept standard or emerging
standard formats such as XML, JSON, HTML, Turtle and the Atom
Syndication Format.</p>
<p>OSLC domain specifications are also expected to follow common practices
and conventions that are in concert with existing industry standards and
offer consistency across domains. All of the OSLC specifications are
built upon the standard RDF data model, allowing OSLC to align with the
W3C&rsquo;s Linked Data initiative. In addition, all OSLC specifications have
adopted the convention to illustrate RDF/XML representations and will
typically require RDF/XML representations to enable consistency across
OSLC implementations. For those reasons, OSLC Services <strong>SHOULD</strong>
provide and accept RDF/XML representations for each OSLC resource.</p>
<p>Though the OSLC Core workgroup does provide guidance on how to form
RDF/XML representations using a subset of RDF/XML (reference: <a href="OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">Appendix
B - Representation Guidance and
Examples</a>), OSLC clients <strong>SHOULD
NOT</strong> assume any specific form of RDF/XML. It is <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong> that
OSLC Services also provide an HTML representation for each resource.</p>
<h3 id="use-standard-content-types">Use standard content-types</h3>
<p>Note that existing standard content-types are used, e.g.
<code>application/rdf+xml</code> and <code>application/json</code>, in this document and no
new content-types are introduced (except for the one introduced in the
<a href="OslcCoreUiPreview">UI Preview specification</a>). Those writing OSLC
specifications are strongly encouraged to follow this pattern &ndash; use
standard and existing content-types and avoid inventing new
content-types for existing formats.</p>
<p>In past OSLC specifications we defined a specific RDF/XML format for
each resource defined and gave each its own content-type. This implied
to consumers that each resource had a different format when in reality
they were all standard RDF/XML. Using different content-types makes it
more difficult to write generic tools, crawlers and other services that
work across all data.</p>
<h3 id="order-of-property-values-insignificant">Order of property values insignificant</h3>
<p>This specification defines how OSLC property values are to be
represented in a variety of formats. Except in the case of a sorted
Query Response, the ordering of property values is insignificant. OSLC
clients and service providers <strong>MUST</strong> not place any significance on the
ordering of property values in representations.</p>
<h3 id="use-absolute-uris">Use Absolute URIs</h3>
<p>OSLC representations <strong>MUST</strong> use absolute URIs in all cases except XML
representations, where the <code>xml:base</code> attribute may be used to allow
relative URIs to be resolved to absolute form (reference: XML Base).</p>
<p>Before a resource representation that uses xml:base is posted to an OSLC
Service for creation, it may include relative URIs that cannot be
resolved until the OSLC Service has received, created and assigned a URI
to the new resource.</p>
