# User Guide

This document gives instructions on how to create content for the site. We
welcome contributions from the OSLC community, whether than be a new resource,
a blog post, or something else that adds value. You can submit content via a
pull request, and every request will be reviewed. If there are review comments,
we will add them in the pull request. There is no guarantee that your content
will be approved, and it is a good idea to get feedback on the idea first
before writing the content. This can be done my opening a github issue, and
using the label 'Content'.

## Notions from Hugo
The main notion from Hugo is something called Front Matter and it's the use of
metadata for each page or single page. For this site we are using TOML so
everything between `+++` and `+++` it is Front Matter tags. In other words
everything you put between `+++` and `+++` it's called meta information or
Front Matter of the post or page and it's gonna be the information needed for
the correct running of the post or page and everything you put after the second
`+++` it's the actual content for that post or page. Some of the information in
the Front Matter it's gonna be displayed like the `title`, `author` and `date`

# How to update content for the existent pages

The file `index.md` in each folder is used for rendering custom information
like title, description of sections and more.

## How to update the existent for About Page

To modify the content of this website you have to update the files in the

In the About Page we use custom tags for custom sections, for example to add a
new organization brand or team member you have to create a single file with the
corresponding tag, example: "people" or "brand".

## How to update the Resources page 
In the Resources Page you will see all the content you put in
/content/resources, every markdown file needs to match the following attributes
in the Front Matter.

**Tags needed in the Front Matter for new posts in the Resource Page**

* Title is the title of the post
* Date is the date in format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+00:00, where the last 4 digts
  are the UTC timezone

  tutorial, video, website, white paper
* Author is the name of the person or organization who writes the post

`content/contribute/*.md`

## How to update the News page (Blog)

Every markdown file you create in the content/news folder is gonna be displayed
in the News Page (oscl-site/news) and has to follow these recommendations.

**Tags needed in the Front Matter for new posts in the News Page**

oslc-site/news/name-of-the-file 

# How to add new content

If you want to add a new top page like `oslc-site/example` you have to create
two new folders one in `/content/new-page` and other in
`/themes/oslc/layouts/new-page` and then you need to create this files:
`/content/new-page/_index.md` `/themes/oslc/layouts/new-page/list.html` 

You can use the command `hugo new new_page/new_page` but only generates the
content folder, you need to create manually the files `single.html` and
`list.html` inside the `/themes/oslc/layouts/new_page/` in order to use that
page.

Also, for display single elements of that url like
`oslc-site/example/single-item` you need to add a `single.html` file in
`/themes/oslc/layouts/new-page/` in order to render the content from
`/content/example-single.md`

The difference between `list.html` and `single.html` is that the first is used
to display the template of a page and the second is used for the posts.

For reference you can copy the content from `/content/example` and
`/themes/oslc/layouts/example` to your new page and update depending on what
you need

# How to add new work group content
